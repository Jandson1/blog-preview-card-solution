### What I learned

Some important parts of the code are:

:root {
    --cor-primaria: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
    --cor-secundaria: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
```
```css
#tema:hover {
    color: var(--cor-primaria);
    cursor: pointer;
}

p:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```


### Continued development

I intend to focus on building projects daily to improve my web development practice, improving my skills in usability, customer experience and clean code.
